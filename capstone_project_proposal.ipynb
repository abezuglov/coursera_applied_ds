    "An average american moves 11.4 times in their lifetime, according to U.S. Census bureau. In case of cross country relocations, people sometimes have little knowledge of the new residence and its surroundings and so it may take months to adapt. One way to mitigate the problem is to find neighborhood(s) that are similar to that of the persons' previous residence. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the goal of this project is to help people that are planning to move with finding the best fit neighborhood. The author also has a personal interest in the project as he is currently planning a cross-country move to Raleigh, North Carolina. The neighborhood to find similarity is also one of the authors' previous residences in Murraywood, Columbia, South Carolina. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that even though these cities and neighborhoods have been chosen, the project code can easily adapt to work with practically *any* state in the United States.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach to solution is clustering neighborhoods in Raleigh and identifying which cluster Murraywood is in. That cluster will contain similar neighborhoods that should be recommended."
