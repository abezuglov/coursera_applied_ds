    "An average american moves 11.4 times in their lifetime, according to U.S. Census bureau. In case of cross country relocations, people sometimes have little knowledge about the new residence and its surroundings. Some might prefer neighborhoods with young families and entertainment, some -- more established neighborhoods, where the majority of residents have paid off their houses. To make things worse, there is lack of well structured information (not the data) and anecdotal evidences may affect people decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to mitigate the problem is to find neighborhood(s) similar to that of the persons' previous residence. To summarize, the objective of this project is to help people that are planning to move with finding the best fit neighborhood at the new residence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond this class, the author also has a personal interest in the project as we are currently planning a cross-country move to Raleigh, North Carolina. For the 'ideal match', we used one of the authors' previous residences -- Murraywood, Columbia, South Carolina. Even though these cities and neighborhoods appear in the project, the code can easily adapt to pull data and work for practically *any* state in the United States.  \n",
